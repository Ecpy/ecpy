Extending Ecpy
==============

Ecpy is designed with the idea that user should be able to extend it to fit 
their own needs. The following section will describe how one should proceed to
do so. The three first sections describe general concepts which are always 
applicable, the following ones are dedicated to the extension of specific part
of the application.

If you need to extend the functionalities provided by an extension package
please refer to its documentation for the specifics of the procedure.

.. note::

   When writing code for ecpy, or an extension packages you should follow the
   project style guides described in :ref:`Styles guides`. Of course if you are
   developing a private extension you are free to do as you see fit but in 
   order for a contribution to Ecpy or one of its official extension package
   to be accepted it must follow those style guides.
